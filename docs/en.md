# Ring for Gladys Assistant

Bring your **Ring video doorbells, cameras and Ring Alarm** into Gladys: a doorbell press or a
motion starts your scenes in real time, the camera snapshot shows on your dashboard, and you can
switch the floodlight or sound the siren from Gladys.

> **Developed without the hardware: feedback welcome.** This integration was written and tested
> against recorded Ring API data, not against real devices. If something behaves oddly with your
> model, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/guim31/gladys-ring/issues)
> or post on the Gladys forum: your feedback is what makes it reliable.

Every camera also shows its connection on its card: **Cloud** when online, **Unreachable** when
Ring reports it offline.

On top of the devices:

- **Scene triggers**: _Ring doorbell pressed_, _Ring motion detected_ (filter on what moved:
  person, vehicle, package or other motion) and _Ring Alarm mode changed_ (from Gladys, the Ring
  app or a keypad).
- **Scene actions**: _Take a Ring snapshot_ and _Set the Ring Alarm mode_.
- **Dashboard widget** _Ring doorbell_: last snapshot, time of the last ring and of the last
  motion, battery, connection, and buttons to refresh the snapshot, switch the light, and sound
  the siren (with a confirmation).

Requirements: **Gladys Assistant 5.1 or later** and a Ring account. No Ring Protect plan is needed,
except for Ring's own smart alerts (person, vehicle, package): without a plan, every motion is
reported as "other motion".

## Sign in to Ring

Ring requires two-step verification on every account, so signing in takes one extra step. You only
do it once: Ring renews the token regularly, and the integration saves every renewed token in its
own storage, so it stays signed in across restarts and updates.

### Option 1: from Gladys (recommended)

1. Open the integration's **Configuration** tab.
2. Fill in **Ring email** and **Ring password**, then **Save**.
3. Click **Send a verification code**. Ring sends you a code by text message, email or
   authenticator app, as set in your Ring account; the message under the button says where.
4. Type the code in **Confirm the verification code** and run it, within 10 minutes.
5. The status turns to connected, and your devices appear in the **Discovery** tab.
6. You can now clear the password field and save: it is not needed anymore.

Ring limits verification codes to 10 every 10 minutes: if you asked for too many, wait a little.

### Option 2: with a refresh token, from a computer

If you prefer not to type your password in Gladys, generate a token on any computer with
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed:

```bash
npx -p ring-client-api ring-auth-cli
```

The tool asks for your Ring email, password and verification code, then prints a line like
`"refreshToken": "eyJydCI6..."`. Copy the long token (between the quotes, without them; pasting the
whole line works too) into the **Refresh token** field of the Configuration tab, and save.

### Where to see and revoke the access

In the Ring app, the integration shows as **Gladys Assistant** under _Control Center → Authorized
Client Devices_. Removing it there signs Gladys out.

### "Ring refused the token"

This message means Ring no longer accepts the saved token: it was removed in the Control Center,
the account password changed, or the token was mistyped. Sign in again with option 1 or 2. The
integration retries a refused token every 30 minutes on its own, and Ring outages every 5 minutes.

## Add your devices

Open the **Discovery** tab and add the devices you want. Gladys keeps the feature names chosen
when a device is added: pick the **Language of the device names** in the Configuration tab first
(English or French).

The camera snapshot appears in the Gladys camera box and in the _Ring doorbell_ widget.

## Options

- **Refresh the snapshots**: every 10, 30 (default) or 60 minutes, or only on events and on
  request. On top of that, the snapshot of every ring and motion is fetched right away when Ring
  attached one, and opening a camera on the dashboard asks for a fresh one. Battery cameras are
  spared: a snapshot asked within 10 minutes of the previous one is reused instead of waking the
  camera, which would drain the battery.
- **Allow Gladys to arm and disarm the Ring Alarm**: off by default. When off, the alarm mode is
  only displayed. When on, anyone who can use your Gladys dashboards and scenes can disarm your
  alarm: turn it on only if that is what you want. Some sensors (an open window when arming) need a
  bypass that only the Ring app can grant: Gladys then reports that the mode could not be set.

## Scene ideas

- **Someone rings, picture on my phone**: trigger _Ring doorbell pressed_ → action _Take a Ring
  snapshot_ on that doorbell → core action _Send a camera image_ of the same camera.
- **Person in the driveway at night**: trigger _Ring motion detected_, camera = Driveway, what
  moved = Person → condition on the time → turn on the floodlight (its _Light_ feature) and your
  Gladys lights.
- **Ring Alarm armed → Gladys away mode**: trigger _Ring Alarm mode changed_, new mode = Away →
  set the Gladys house alarm, turn off the lights and the heating.

In the messages of a scene, `{{triggerEvent.data.device_name}}` is the name of the camera, and
`{{triggerEvent.data.detection}}` what moved (`person`, `vehicle`, `package` or `motion`).

## How it talks to Ring, and how often

Ring has no public API. The integration uses
[ring-client-api](https://github.com/dgreif/ring), the open source library behind Homebridge
Ring, which speaks to Ring's cloud the way the Ring app does. Everything goes through the cloud:
Ring devices offer no local access.

- **Presses and motions** arrive in real time as **push notifications**, the same channel as the
  Ring app (Firebase Cloud Messaging). It needs outgoing connections to `mtalk.google.com` on TCP
  port 5228: if your firewall or DNS ad blocker blocks them, presses and motions will not arrive.
- **Camera status** (battery, light, siren, online): one request every 60 seconds for the whole
  account, the pace of the Home Assistant integration.
- **Ring Alarm**: pushed in real time over a WebSocket, no polling.
- **Snapshots**: one request per camera at the interval you chose, plus one per event and per
  dashboard request (a request made within 30 seconds of the previous one reuses it).

Ring publishes no quota for this API. These rates are those of the established integrations;
please do not change them.

The integration runs comfortably within Gladys' 256 MB sandbox: about 120 MB at rest, about
190 MB at worst while shrinking a large snapshot (measured on Node 22).

## Limits

- **No live video and no recordings**: Gladys shows snapshots, not streams, and recordings need a
  Ring Protect plan. Both are out of scope.
- A camera whose **motion detection is turned off** (in the Ring app or by a Ring mode) takes no
  snapshot: Ring refuses it. Battery cameras cannot take a snapshot while someone watches their
  live view.
- Snapshots above the Gladys limit (150 KB) are downsized before being shown.
- Only the Ring Alarm **security panel, contact sensors and motion detectors** are supported for
  now: not the keypad, flood/freeze, smoke/CO listener, glass break or range extender. Ring Smart
  Lighting, Chimes, Intercom and third-party cameras are not supported either.
- The integration has no settings of its own for units: it shows percentages, and dates in your
  Gladys time zone (12-hour clock in English).
- A press stays active on the device card for 15 seconds; a motion stays detected for a minute
  after Ring's last notification.

## Your data

The Ring token and the hardware id sent to Ring are stored in the integration's own folder on your
Gladys machine (`/data`), never in a log. The password, if you typed one, stays in the Gladys
configuration until you clear it. Nothing is sent anywhere but to Ring.
